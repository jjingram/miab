# Email2Chat specification
Version 0.1.0

Email2Chat (or E2C for short) is a simple specification that allows E2C clients to facilitate conversational style email exchanges between individuals. In v0.1.0 anything beyond plain text conversations between individuals is outside the scope of the specification.

* [Conversational emails](#conversational-emails)
* [Outgoing emails](#outgoing-emails)
* [Incoming emails](#incoming-emails)
* [Forwarded emails](#forwarded-emails)

## Conversational emails
* A 'conversation' is defined as the concatenation of all 'conversation sections' in chronological order.
* A 'conversation section' is defined as any 'thread' which begins with an email with an `Email2Chat-Version` header.
* An email that has an `Email2Chat-Version` header, or has been replied to by an email with an `Email2Chat-Version` header, is known as a 'conversational email'.
* Any email that isn't a 'conversational email' is not handled by E2C clients.

## Outgoing emails
E2C clients must add an `Email2Chat-Version: 0.1.0` header to outgoing emails. It is up to the client to decide the nature and content of the `Subject` header. The body must contain text which must have the content-type `text/plain; charset=utf-8`.

For example:

```
From: sender@domain
To: rcpt@domain
Content-Type: text/plain
Email2Chat-Version: 0.1.0

Hello, World!
```

## Incoming emails
The `Email2Chat-Version` header may be used to detect if an email comes from a compatible E2C client. The `Subject` header must not be used to detect compatible emails.

In the case of a 'normal' email; those emails lacking an `Email2Chat-Version` header; E2C clients should show the content of the `Subject` header. In addition, the email's body should be interpreted as plain text. Attachments are currently out of the scope of this specification.

## Forwarded emails
Forwarded emails are currently out of the scope of this specification.
